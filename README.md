# Running The Application

In order to run the application, the user must have Node.js downloaded. The installer can be found on the following website:
https://nodejs.org/en/download

Once you have Node installed on the device, clone the Git repository to your local computer. Open a terminal up within the git repository and run the command (npm i) from the back-end folder and the front-end folder. This will install the node modules required for both servers.
For deploying the system, I recommend opening two terminals, one located in the root directory (to run back-end) and one located in the front-end file.
To run the back-end server, simply type into the back-end folder terminal
Nodemon server.js
During development, Nodemon is incredibly useful to restart the server if there have been any files changes within the directory of the back-end server, therefore any modifications to the server code will automatically restart it.

To run the front-end server, simply type into the front-end folder terminal
Npm start

This will run the website and the back-end server to allow for interaction between the two. Currently, I am using MongoDB on my local device as a temporary solution, therefore anyone attempting to deploy the website will struggle to login / register (unless they have it installed on their local machine), however once I move the database over to the cloud solution, it should provide a fix for this issue.  
In order to deploy the website within itâ€™s current form, the user requires MongoDB on their local machine. This can be done through the following website:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
or through mongosh (after installing the server) via:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/?_ga=2.80922007.1681306570.1701989949-391924372.1690298159
